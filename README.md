# RTOS Task Scheduler Simulation

ðŸŽ¯ **Simulates a simple RTOS task scheduler in C, with round-robin and priority-based scheduling.**
Runs entirely on a laptop â€” no hardware needed â€” to demonstrate embedded software concepts.

---

##  Features
âœ… Simulates multiple tasks (as functions).  
âœ… Supports two scheduling algorithms:
- Round-Robin
- Priority-Based
âœ… Simulates context switching & time slices.  
âœ… Written in pure C, portable to any platform with a C compiler.

---

## How to Run

### ðŸ›  Prerequisites
- C compiler (`gcc`, `clang`, etc.)
- Git (optional, for version control)

###  Build
On Linux/Mac:
```bash
gcc rtos_scheduler.c -o rtos_scheduler
./rtos_scheduler
